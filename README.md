# Game-cheats-WIP-
this is a opensource (not really) although i will be showing how to make a ui/gui  
# G-M-Executor.js
 Use G-M-Executor.js to run the code or you can just use bookmarks but i think you should use G-M-Executor.js
  G-M-Executor.js: https://github.com/Zaidbaidadekalb/-G-M-Executor.js
  
  # Key System 
  ``` js
  let keys = [
"Zaid2",
"Zaid",
"Free Key",
"SHH",

];
var text = prompt("Please enter Your key ", ""); alert("You have entered " + text + " Is this the correct key?"); 
if (keys.includes(text)) {
 alert("ok");
} else {
alert("wrong key");
}

```
